# A Wedding Manager

So, next year (2023), my partner and I are getting married. We've been engaged for about 4 years now, so it's been a long time coming. We're finally getting our act together and locking in a date. The topic of invites came up and I thought, with my newfound software engineering skills, I'd build our invites online. This webapp is the result of that thought.
